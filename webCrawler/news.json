{"articles": "The White House has abandoned the idea of President Trump visiting FBI headquarters after being told he would not be greeted warmly administration officials told NBC News Amid the continuing fallout over his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey Trump was considering an appearance at the FBIs J Edgar Hoover Building in downtown Washington DC The White House publicly floated the idea as recently as Thursday morning Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked by a reporter whether such a visit was imminent replied I believe that its very likely that takes place sometime in the next few days But that idea was dropped later Thursday administration officials said after the FBI told the White House the optics would not be good FBI officials made clear that the president would not draw many smiles and cheers having just unceremoniously sacked a very popular director And FBI agents said that while many of them voted for Trump after the president unceremoniously fired a very popular director few were ready to meet him at the bureau with open arms My sense is most FBI employees feel a loyalty to Comey one person who works at headquarters told NBC News And whether they agree or disagree with the way he handled the email case like and respect him  Trump would not be well-received at headquarters On Wednesday Huckabee Sanders said the president will be meeting with Acting Director Andrew McCabe later today to discuss that very thing  the morale at the FBI  as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that thats necessary and appropriate Senior White House officials later walked that back slightly telling NBC News that while Trump was weighing a visit to the FBI building the details were still being worked out in the morning By Thursday afternoon the plan had been completely nixed Comeys dismissal on Tuesday came as a shock to the political world In a letter to FBI employees Comey said he wouldnt spend time thinking about why and how the president fired him and told his former colleagues to do the same Comey called the bureau a rock for America and said he hopes it will continue to uphold the Constitution I have said to you before that in times of turbulence the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence honesty and independence Comey wrote in his farewell letter What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people who together make it that rock for America President Trump on Thursday named Kris W Kobach the Kansas secretary of state who has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on undocumented immigrants to a commission investigating vote fraud following through on his unsubstantiated claim that millions of illegals voted for his Democratic rival and robbed him of victory in the national popular vote Mr Kobach who has championed the strictest voter identification laws in the country will be the vice chairman of the commission which will be led by Vice President Mike Pence and is expected to include about a dozen others including state officials from both political parties said Sarah Huckabee Sanders the deputy White House press secretary Mr Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating the commission which Ms Sanders said would have a broad mandate to review policies and practices that affect Americans’ confidence in the integrity of federal elections Marc E Lotter Mr Pence’s spokesman said that voter suppression would be among the topics studied by the commission which he said would take a wide-ranging look at problems at the state and national levels But the order makes no mention of suppression or voting restrictions specifying only improper or fraudulent registration and voting as issues to be explored Democrats and civil rights groups condemned the panel as a taxpayer-funded witch hunt and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a legal request to the White House for records showing concrete evidence of fraudulent voting that would warrant the creation of such a commission Steve Harvey isnt apologizing for a viral memo he sent to co-workers instructing them not to pop by his office unannounced  or even try to walk with him in the hallway The comedian doubled down on the no-nonsense approach he decided to employ with the staff members of his daytime talk show explaining that some colleagues began to take advantage of his previously inviting nature after a while I could not find a way to walk from the stage to my dressing room to sit in my makeup chair to walk from my dressing room to the stage or to just sit and have lunch without somebody just walking in he told Entertainment Tonight Ive always had a policy where you know you can come and talk to me  so many people are great around here but some of them just started taking advantage of it Harveys straight-forward memo to his co-workers was distributed ahead of the fifth season of his former program Steve Harvey according to Variety"
